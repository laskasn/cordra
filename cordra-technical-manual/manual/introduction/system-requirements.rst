===================

======================  =======================================
Minimum                 Recommended
======================  =======================================
JVM: Java version 8     JVM: Java version 8 or later
CPU: Single core 1GHz   CPU: Single core 2GHz
RAM: 500MB              RAM: 2GB
HDD: 200MB              HDD: Storage dependent
======================  =======================================

Storage is used for just logging system access if external backend services are employed.
Otherwise, required storage space is dependent on the number and size of objects that are
stored and indexed as well as the number of user requests. In general, and up to a certain point,
more system memory will yield better search performance.
